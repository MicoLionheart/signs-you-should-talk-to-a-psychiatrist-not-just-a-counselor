            <h2>1. Understanding the Difference</h2>
            <h3>Psychiatrist vs. Counselor</h3>
            <p>While both psychiatrists and counselors play important roles in mental health care, their approaches and expertise differ. Counselors focus on talk therapy to address emotional and behavioral challenges, while psychiatrists are medical doctors who can diagnose mental health conditions and prescribe medications. Knowing when to see a psychiatrist can make a significant difference in your treatment journey.</p>
